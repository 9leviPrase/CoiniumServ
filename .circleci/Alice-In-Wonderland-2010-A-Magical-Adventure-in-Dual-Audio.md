## Alice In Wonderland 2010: A Star-Studded Cast
 
Alice In Wonderland 2010 boasts a star-studded cast of talented actors, both in live-action and voice roles. The film features some of Tim Burton's frequent collaborators, such as Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Danny Elfman. It also introduces some new faces to Burton's world, such as Mia Wasikowska, Anne Hathaway, and Crispin Glover.
 
Mia Wasikowska plays Alice, the curious and courageous heroine who embarks on a journey of self-discovery in Wonderland. Wasikowska was chosen for her natural beauty and intelligence, as well as her ability to portray Alice's emotional arc. She was 19 years old at the time of filming, the same age as Alice in the film.
 
Johnny Depp plays the Mad Hatter, Alice's eccentric and loyal friend who suffers from mercury poisoning. Depp based his performance on Scottish and Irish accents, as well as his own personality quirks. He also wore different colored contact lenses to show the Hatter's mood swings.
 
Helena Bonham Carter plays the Red Queen, the cruel and vain ruler of Wonderland who has a large head and a small body. Bonham Carter wore a prosthetic forehead and chin to enhance her features, and her head was digitally enlarged in post-production. She also wore a corset and high heels to make her appear taller.
 
Anne Hathaway plays the White Queen, the Red Queen's sister and rival who has a pure and graceful appearance. Hathaway based her performance on Nigella Lawson, a British TV chef who has a sensual way of speaking. She also wore long white hair extensions and pale makeup to contrast with the Red Queen.
 
Crispin Glover plays Stayne, the Knave of Hearts, the Red Queen's right-hand man and lover who has a scarred face and a heart-shaped eye patch. Glover wore stilts and a motion-capture suit to portray Stayne, who is over eight feet tall in the film. He also performed his own stunts in the action scenes.
 
Matt Lucas plays Tweedledee and Tweedledum, two identical twins who are loyal to the Mad Hatter and often finish each other's sentences. Lucas played both roles using motion-capture technology and split-screen effects. He also provided the voices for both characters.
