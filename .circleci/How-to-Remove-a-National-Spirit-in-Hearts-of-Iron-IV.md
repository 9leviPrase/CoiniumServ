However, sometimes you may want to remove a national spirit manually, either because it is bugged, outdated, or simply annoying. For example, you may want to get rid of the Great Depression as the United States, or the London Stock Market Crash as Poland. Fortunately, there is a way to do that using console commands.
 
Console commands are special codes that you can type in the game's console to perform various actions. To open the console, press the tilde key (~) on your keyboard. You can also use Shift+2, ALT+2+1, or Shift+3 depending on your keyboard layout. To close the console, press the same key again.
 
To remove a national spirit using console commands, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Type `debug` in the console and press enter. This will enable debug mode, which will show you additional information about various game elements.
2. Hover over the national spirit that you want to remove and check its debug key name. This is a unique identifier for each national spirit that looks something like `JAP_militarism` or `POL_london_stock_market_crash`.
3. Type `remove_ideas ` in the console and press enter. For example, if you want to remove Japan's Militarism national spirit, type `remove_ideas JAP_militarism`. This will remove the national spirit from your country.
4. Type `debug` again in the console and press enter to disable debug mode.

Congratulations! You have successfully removed a national spirit from your country. You can use this method to remove any national spirit that you don't like or need. However, be careful not to remove any national spirit that is essential for your country's gameplay or history, as this may cause unintended consequences or break your game.

National spirits are not the only way to customize your country in Hearts of Iron IV. You can also use national focuses, which are special projects that give you various bonuses, events, or decisions. National focuses are divided into generic and unique ones. Generic national focuses are available to all countries, while unique ones are specific to certain countries or regions. For example, Germany has a unique national focus tree that lets them choose between different political paths, such as Nazism, Democracy, or Monarchy.
 
To access your national focus tree, click on the button with a star icon on the top left corner of the screen. This will open a menu where you can see your current and available national focuses. To start a national focus, click on it and confirm your choice. Each national focus takes a certain amount of time to complete, depending on its difficulty and your political power. You can only have one active national focus at a time, unless you have certain modifiers that allow you to have more.
 
National focuses can have various effects on your country and the world. Some of them can give you research bonuses, factories, resources, or military units. Others can trigger events that can change your political ideology, start a war, or form a faction. Some national focuses can also unlock decisions, which are special actions that you can take using political power. Decisions can have various effects as well, such as boosting your stability, increasing your war support, or influencing other countries.
